# What does our project do?
Our project is designed for the user to make a shopping list that includes the total price of the items
that they add through text boxes.

This includes the name of the item, the number of items, and the category that the item belongs to.

There will also be a graph for the prices of the items added.

The user also has the option of using Google Maps to find the nearest grocery store.
